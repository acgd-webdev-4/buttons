# Buttons

## Overview

- *Continue work on your `dog-rescue-pattern-library`*
- Working on your `button` pattern, style all the buttons necessary for your website.
- Think about all the different styles you’ll need: Do you need small buttons? Big buttons? Different colours? Different shapes? Will you need buttons with icons in the future?
- Add transitions, gradients & hover states to the buttons.
- *Run your pattern library through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Details

- *Default button:* Style the default `.btn` class
- *Extra buttons:* Style all the other classes you’ll need for your website. If `.btn-ghost` & `.btn-light` don’t make sense create new classes.
- *When & why:* In the `README.md` file describe when to use each button style and why the buttons are the way they are.

**You don’t have to regenerate your Pattern Library after every change.** If you’re only changing `buttons.html` or `buttons.css` open the HTML file directly in your browser like you’re used to.
